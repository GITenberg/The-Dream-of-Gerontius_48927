<p>As a rule, when Cardinal Newman's poetry is mentioned,
people think of "The Pillar of the Cloud," better
known as "Lead, Kindly Light." This lyric is
only one of the many beautiful poems written by an
author whose fame as a writer of the finest modern
prose in the English language has eclipsed his reputation
as a poet. Nevertheless, he wrote a very great
poem, "The Dream of Gerontius"&mdash;a poem which the
intellectual world admires more and more every year,
and which yields its best only after careful study and
consideration. It has been described as a metrical
meditation on death. It is more than that; it is the
realization by means of a loving heart and a poetic
imagination of the state of a just soul after death,&mdash;Gerontius
typifying not the soul of a particular person
imagined by Cardinal Newman, but your soul, my soul,
any soul which may be fortunate enough to satisfy the
judging and merciful God. No poet has ever presented
the condition of the soul, as made known by
the theology of the Catholic Church, so forcibly and
appealingly as Cardinal Newman. The poem is filled
with intense white light, and the soul on earth sees itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
as it will be at the moment before its death; as it will be
when, strengthened by the last sacraments and upborne
by the prayers of its friends, it approaches the bar of
judgment. Separated from the body until the day of
the Resurrection, when it shall be united to that glorified
body, it is not sundered by death from the love of those
who have loved it on earth. Gerontius about to be judged
feels that he must fail</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry indent"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"And drop from out the universal frame</div>
  <div class="verse">Into that shapeless, scopeless, blank abyss,</div>
  <div class="verse">That utter nothingness"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>from which the soul came, and, in its depths of fear,
it pleads silently that its friends in Christ may pray for
it. The dread of annihilation is upon it; it fears "the
great deep"<a name="Anchor-1" id="Anchor-1"></a><a href="#Footnote-1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a> to which it goes. And, in the agony of
its rending from the beloved body, it thinks&mdash;for
it can no longer speak&mdash;of the horror of nothingness.
All its physical supports are gone. Its eyes are
darkening and glazing; its feet motionless and cold;
its arms and hands rigid. To those in the sick-room
the body once so beautiful,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry indent"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">"from the graced decorum of the hair</div>
  <div class="verse">Ev'n to the tingling sweet</div>
  <div class="verse">Soles of the simple, earth-confiding feet,"<a name="Anchor-2" id="Anchor-2"></a><a href="#Footnote-2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>is now white as white marble and as lifeless. But the
soul is not dead, though the earthly parts of the body
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>appear to be, and it hears the prayers of the Church
for the dying as the supreme moment of its departure
from the body is at hand. Some of these prayers,
translated from the Latin, the author puts into the
mouths of the assistants. They have all the refreshing
strength that the Church gives; they represent the supplication
of millions of devout souls bound to this dying
brother in the communion of saints. The soul gains
new strength from these prayers; it arouses itself; sees
God through the ruin of the world, and wills to be wholly
His. The assistants by the bedside redouble their supplications
in the sacred words of the Litany for the
Dying, which Cardinal Newman again interprets in
English verse, though the Litany is in the Latin tongue.
Again, the soul gains strength for a moment, and calls,
in the universal speech of the Church, for strength,
and that, "out of the depths,"<a name="Anchor-3" id="Anchor-3"></a><a href="#Footnote-3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the holy God might save
it. Then it uses its will to believe, and within itself asserts
the creed of the Church, which is musically interpreted
by the poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry indent"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"Firmly I believe and truly</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">God is Three, and God is One,</div>
  <div class="verse">And I next acknowledge duly</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Manhood taken by the Son."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The moment of agony, the moment of the realization
of the soul that it is alone, bereft of its support, is ter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>rible
but short. In the "Inferno" of Dante, with
all its objective horrors, there are no lines so terrible as
these, which show the spirit naked, wild with horror
and dismay:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry indent"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">"And worse and worse,</div>
  <div class="verse">Some bodily form of ill</div>
  <div class="verse">Floats on the wind, with many a loathsome curse</div>
  <div class="verse">Tainting the hallowed air, and laughs and flaps</div>
  <div class="verse">Its hideous wings."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We can imagine the scene in the room in which Gerontius
is dying. The priest, in his surplice and violet
stole, has sprinkled the chamber and the persons present
with holy water, using the form of the cross, and has
said the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Asperges</i>:</p>

<p>"Thou shall sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be
cleansed: Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made
whiter than snow."</p>

<p>Gerontius has kissed the crucifix, and it is still before
him. In the glow of the lighted candle the "Litany
for the Dying" is recited by the priest and the "assistants,"
that is to say, all in the room who will pray. The
passing of the soul may not have occupied a second, as
we reckon time, and yet, as "The Dream of Gerontius"
suggests, the soul, sensitive and vital, may live
through what might seem to be a hundred years. As
soon as it appears that the soul has departed, the priest
says:</p>

<p>"Subvenite, Sancti Dei, occurrite Angeli Domini,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Suscipientes animam ejus, Offerentes eam in conspectu
Altissimi."<a name="Anchor-4" id="Anchor-4"></a><a href="#Footnote-4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4.">[4]</a></p>

<p>This prayer dwells last in the ears of Gerontius. He
has slept for a moment, refreshed by the Church, and
he awakes to find himself free.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry indent"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"I had a dream; yes: some one softly said</div>
  <div class="verse">'He's gone,' and then a sigh went round the room,</div>
  <div class="verse">And then I surely heard a priestly voice</div>
  <div class="verse">Cry 'Subvenite,' and they knelt in prayer."<a name="Anchor-5" id="Anchor-5"></a><a href="#Footnote-5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5.">[5]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The soul, borne forward on its way to the Judge, hears
the song of its Guardian Angel, whose work is done. As
the soul proceeds, the voices of the demons are heard;
they express the pride of those who defy God. They
cry out:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry indent"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"Virtue and vice,</div>
  <div class="verse">A knave's pretence,</div>
  <div class="verse">'Tis all the same."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The soul wonders why it cannot move hand or foot,
and the angel says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry indent"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"Nor hast thou now extension, with its parts</div>
  <div class="verse">Correlative,&mdash;long habit cozens thee,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="verse">Nor power to move thyself, nor limbs to move."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>So infinitesimal has the time been since the soul left
the body that the "Subvenite" is not yet finished when the
soul is at the very throne of Judgment:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry indent"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"I hear the voices that I left on earth."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The angel answers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry indent"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"It is the voice of friends around thy bed</div>
  <div class="verse">Who say the 'Subvenite' with the priest."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The angel of the Agony supplicates for the soul, as
for its brother, and then the eager spirit darts forward
alone to the feet of God. Gerontius is judged; he passes
lovingly to Purgatory. His Guardian Angel says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry indent"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">"And ye great powers,</div>
  <div class="verse">Angels of Purgatory, receive from me</div>
  <div class="verse">My charge, a precious soul, until the day</div>
  <div class="verse">When, from all bond and forfeiture released,</div>
  <div class="verse">I shall reclaim it for the courts of light."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Waiting until he shall enter into the full glory of the
Lord, Gerontius is left by the poet. This soul knows
now what it did not know on earth,&mdash;what the real
happiness of Heaven is; "it measures the distance which
separates itself from this happiness. It understands how
infinite this distance is, through its own fault. It suffers
terribly. Its sorrow grows with its love, as it loves God
more and more with all the fibres of its being; it is
drawn by vital and mighty bonds towards the object
of its love, but each bond is broken by the weight of its
faults, which like a mass of lead hold it down."<a name="Anchor-6" id="Anchor-6"></a><a href="#Footnote-6" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 6.">[6]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p>There can be no question as to the correspondence
of the teaching of Cardinal Newman with the theology
of the Catholic Church. Dante is put by Raphael, in
the famous picture, the Disputà, among the Doctors of
the Church, and the author of "The Dream of Gerontius"
would have merited a similar honor even if he
had never been created<a name="Anchor-7" id="Anchor-7"></a><a href="#Footnote-7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7.">[7]</a> a Cardinal.</p>

<p>For advanced students interested in the study of literature
a comparative reading of "The Dream of Gerontius"
with the "Purgatorio" of Dante, Book <abbr title="3">III</abbr>, Milton's
"Paradise Lost," Rossetti's "The Blessed Damosel,"
and Tennyson's "In Memoriam" would be very interesting
and profitable, provided this is done always with
reference to the exact teaching of the Church. For
exalted purity, for terseness and beauty of expression,
for musical cadences, "The Dream of Gerontius" stands
first among the few great poems that depict the life
after death. "In Memoriam" is made up of human
yearnings, of faith, of doubt. It never passes beyond
"the bar" of death. Milton's "Paradise" is one of
angels rather than men, and Rossetti's poem is only a
reflection of earth. In Dante's "Purgatorio" the splendor
seems to be so great that the appeal to the individual
heart is lost, but the oftener we read "The
Dream of Gerontius," the more its power and beauty
and peace grow upon us.</p>

<p>The story of General Charles George Gordon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
"Chinese Gordon," one of the heroes of the nineteenth
century, has passed into history, and every enthusiastic
boy or girl ought to know it by heart. Gordon was the
type of the valiant soldier who carried the love and fear
of God everywhere. He, besieged by pagan hordes,
died, in 1884, the death of a martyr to duty. This man
was only one of those who found consolation in "The
Dream of Gerontius" at the very hour of death. General
Gordon's copy of the poem&mdash;a small duodecimo&mdash;was
presented to the late Mr. Frank Power, correspondent
of the London <cite>Times</cite>. The latter sent it home
to his sister in Dublin. Deep pencil-marks had been
drawn under lines all bearing on death and prayer.
For instance: "Pray for me, O my friends"; "'Tis
death, O loving friends, your prayers,&mdash;'tis he"; "So
pray for me, my friends, who have not strength to
pray"; "Use well the interval"; "Prepare to meet thy
God"; "Now that the hour is come, my fear is fled."
Later Power met the fate of a hero. The last words that
Gordon underlined before he gave him the book were:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry indent"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"Farewell, but not forever, brother dear;</div>
  <div class="verse">Be brave and patient on thy bed of sorrow."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The metre in "The Dream of Gerontius" changes
with the thought, and it is always appropriate to it.
The solemn movement of the opening lines gives the
typical music, which is varied lyrically. As an example
of exquisite musical variety on a firm basis of
unity the poem is admirable. The level of "Lead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Kindly Light" is reached many times in the expression
of the highest faith and love, and in musical quality
the famous hymn is even surpassed by</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry indent"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"Take me away, and in the lowest deep</div>
  <div class="verse">There let me be."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Why Cardinal Newman should have presented the
experience of a soul after death as a "dream" we can
imagine from his habitual caution in dealing with all
subjects of importance. He has the boldness of neither
Dante nor Milton, and he will not present the poetical
experience of a man, at such a vitally sacred moment, as
an actual fact; he is too reverential for that, and he calls
it a "Dream." In a letter written in answer to
an inquiry as to the meaning of the lines in "The Pillar
of the Cloud,"</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry indent"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"And with the morn those angel faces smile</div>
  <div class="verse">Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile,"&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>he says, quoting Keble, that poets are "not bound to be
critics or to give a sense to what they had written,"<a name="Anchor-8" id="Anchor-8"></a><a href="#Footnote-8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8.">[8]</a>
and he adds that "there must be a statute of limitations,
or it would be quite a tyranny, if in an art
which is the expression not of truth but of imagination
and sentiment, one were obliged to stand an examination
on the transient state of mind which came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>upon one when homesick, or seasick, or in any other way
sensitive or excited."</p>

<p>It is well to take a great poem like this without too
much inquiry or analysis. If the author's intention is
not evident in his poem, either he has failed to be clear, or
he is consciously obscure, or we are incapable of appreciating
his work. The first and second defects do not
appear in "The Dream of Gerontius." The third,
let us trust, does not exist in us. The notes, few in
number, are intended to explain only what is not obvious.</p>

<p>In his "Recollections" Aubrey De Vere says: "'The
Dream of Gerontius,' as Newman informed me, owed its
preservation to an accident. He had written it on a sudden
impulse, put it aside and forgotten it. The editor
of a magazine"&mdash;it appeared in <cite>The Month</cite>, of London,
1865, in two parts&mdash;"wrote to him asking for a contribution.
He looked into all his pigeon-holes and
found nothing theological; but, in answering his correspondent,
he added that he had come upon some verses
which, if, as editor, he cared to have, were at his command.
The wise editor did care, and they were published
at once."</p>

<p>R. H. Hutton, writing of Cardinal Newman, speaks
in this way of "The Dream of Gerontius": "Before
the Vatican disputes and shortly after the controversy
with Canon Kingsley, Newman had written a poem of
which he himself thought so little that it was, as I have
heard, consigned or doomed to the waste-basket....
Some friend who had an eye for true poetry rescued it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and was the means, therefore, of preserving to the world
one of the most unique and original poems of the present
century, as well as that one of all of them which is, in
every sense, the least in sympathy with the temper of the
present century.... None of his writings engraves more
vividly on his readers the significance of the intensely
practical convictions which shaped his career. And
especially it impresses on us one of the great secrets of
his influence. For Newman has been a sign to this
generation that unless there is a great deal of the loneliness
of death in life, there can hardly be much of the
higher equanimity of life in death. To my mind 'The
Dream of Gerontius' is the poem of a man to whom
the vision of the Christian revelation has at all times been
more real, more potent to influence action, and more
powerful to preoccupy the imagination than all worldly
interests put together." (R. H. Hutton, "Cardinal
Newman.")</p>

<p>The song of the soul in "The Dream of Gerontius"
has sometimes been compared with "The Pillar of the
Cloud"&mdash;a sacred lyric which is a household canticle
wherever the English language is spoken. It is often
misquoted, a fourth stanza having been added to it.
This is the authorized version:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry indent"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Lead Thou me on!</div>
  <div class="verse">The night is dark, and I am far from home&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Lead Thou me on!</div>
  <div class="verse">Keep Thou my feet; I do not ask to see</div>
  <div class="verse">The distant scene&mdash;one step enough for me.</div>
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
  <div class="verse">"I was not ever thus, nor prayed that Thou</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Shouldst lead me on.</div>
  <div class="verse">I loved to choose my path, but now</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Lead Thou me on.</div>
  <div class="verse">I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,</div>
  <div class="verse">Pride ruled my will; remember not past years.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"So long Thy power hath blest me, sure it still</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Will lead me on,</div>
  <div class="verse">O'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent till</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">The night is gone;</div>
  <div class="verse">And with the morn those angel faces smile</div>
  <div class="verse">Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the "Apologia Pro Vita Sua" Dr. Newman wrote:
"We"&mdash;Mr. Hurrell Froude, brother of the historian
James Anthony Froude, being the other person&mdash;"set
out in December 1832. It was during this expedition
that my verses which are in the 'Apostolica' were written&mdash;a
few, indeed, before it, but not more than one or two
of them after it. At Whitechurch, while waiting for the
down mail to Falmouth, I wrote the verses about 'My
Guardian Angel' which begin with these words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry indent"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"'Are these the tracks of some unearthly friend?'"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It must be remembered that John Henry Newman
had not yet entered the Catholic Church. It is strange
that he should at this time have held the belief in a
ministering spirit which is so marked in "The Dream
of Gerontius."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>In the sextette of this sonnet he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry indent"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"Were I Christ's own, then fitly might I call</div>
  <div class="verse">That vision real; for to the thoughtful mind</div>
  <div class="verse">That walks with Him He half reveals His face;</div>
  <div class="verse">But when on earth-stained souls such tokens fall,</div>
  <div class="verse">These dare not claim as theirs what there they find,</div>
  <div class="verse">Yet, not all hopeless, eye His boundless grace."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This vision, he says, "which haunted me,&mdash;the vision
is more or less brought out in the whole series of compositions."
"Gerontius" itself is more a "vision" than
a "dream."</p>

<p>"The Pillar of the Cloud" was written in an orange-boat.
"We were becalmed a whole week in the Straits
of Bonifaccio. Then it was," he says in the "Apologia"&mdash;the
finest model of modern English prose extant&mdash;"that
I wrote 'Lead, Kindly Light,' which has
since become well known. I was writing verses the
whole time of my passage."</p>

<p>The "vision" of which he speaks he saw everywhere,
and all his poems seem, in one way or other, to contain
hints of the great poem to come; for there can be no
doubt that "The Dream of Gerontius" is the culmination
of his poetical moods. One cannot open any of his prose
works without finding allusions to these eternal truths
made so clear through the processes of the soul of a
normal old man,&mdash;our young readers will please look
up the derivation of Gerontius,<a name="Anchor-9" id="Anchor-9"></a><a href="#Footnote-9" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 9.">[9]</a> which is from the
Greek,&mdash;but it is in his poems that we discover easily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>the germs of his poetical masterpiece. Even in the
poems he loved we note the constant dwelling on the
main theme of "The Dream"&mdash;Eternity. In 1889
Cardinal Newman was very ill. During his convalescence
he asked that Faber's "Eternal Years"<a name="Anchor-A" id="Anchor-A"></a><a href="#Footnote-A" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote A.">[A]</a> should
be sung to him with musical accompaniment. He said
that he would like to hear it when he came to die. It
is a poem of sixteen stanzas, to be found in Faber's
"Hymns." It begins:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry indent"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"How shalt thou bear the cross that now</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">So dread a weight appears?</div>
  <div class="verse">Keep quietly to God, and think</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Upon the eternal years.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Austerity is little help,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Although it sometimes cheers;</div>
  <div class="verse">Thine oil of gladness is the thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of the eternal years."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>"Novissima hora est!" Gerontius exclaims, "and I
fain would sleep." He is thinking of the eternal hours
and years in this last hour on earth.</p>

<p>At sea, in June, 1833, Newman had written some
verses called "Hora Novissima":</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry indent"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"Whene'er goes forth Thy dread command,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And my last hour is nigh,</div>
  <div class="verse">Lord, grant me in a Christian land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As I was born, to die.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"I pray not, Lord, that friends may be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Or kindred, standing by,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="verse">Choice blessing! which I leave to Thee</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To grant me or deny.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"But let my falling limbs beneath</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My Mother's smile recline,</div>
  <div class="verse">And prayers sustain my laboring breath</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From out her sacred shrine.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"And let the cross beside my bed</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In its dread presence rest;</div>
  <div class="verse">And let the absolving words be said</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To ease a laden breast.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"Thou, Lord, where'er we lie, canst aid;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But He who taught His own</div>
  <div class="verse">To live as one, will not upbraid</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The dread to die alone."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The death of Gerontius was Newman's ideal Christian
death, and Gerontius does not die alone; he is
upborne, refreshed by the prayers of his friends. Of
Newman's sacred songs, "The Pillar of the Cloud"
is, as we know, put first by some critics. And yet for
musical diction, for sweetness and all the beauty of
artistic technique, the song of the soul in "The Dream"
equals if not surpasses it.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry indent"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">"Take me away, and in the lowest deep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">There let me be,</div>
  <div class="verse">And there in hope the lone night-watches keep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Told out for me."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In "Verses on Various Occasions" there is the picture
of the resigned souls expecting the Blessed Vision.
"Waiting for the Morning" was written at Oxford,
1835. It begins:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry indent"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">"They are at rest;</div>
  <div class="verse">We may not stir the heaven of their repose</div>
  <div class="verse">With loud-voiced grief, or passionate request,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Or selfish plaints for those</div>
  <div class="verse">Who in the mountain grots of Eden lie,</div>
  <div class="verse">And hear the fourfold river as it passes by."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>By "Eden" Newman symbolized the paradise&mdash;the
resting-place of souls&mdash;of the fourfold rivers. Here
they patiently abide,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry indent"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">"And soothing sounds</div>
  <div class="verse">Blend with the neighboring waters as they glide;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Posted along the haunted garden's bounds</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Angelic forms abide,</div>
  <div class="verse">Echoing as words of watch, o'er lawn and grove,</div>
  <div class="verse">The verses of that hymn which seraphs chant above."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The fulness of higher meditation and knowledge is in
the triumphant song of the Soul, but "Waiting for the
Morning" contains its suggestion, just as "The Lady of
Shalott" by Lord Tennyson contains the germ of the
exquisite "Elaine."</p>

<p>The dedication of "The Dream of Gerontius" reads,
in English: "To the Most Beloved Brother, John Joseph
Gordon, Priest of the Order of St. Philip de Neri, whose
soul is in the Place of Refreshment.<a name="Anchor-10" id="Anchor-10"></a><a href="#Footnote-10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10.">[10]</a> All Souls' Day,
1865."</p>

<p>The Rev. John Joseph Gordon, of the Oratory, was
very dear to Newman, and his death was a great blow</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p>to him. But of all the Oratorians, the Cardinal especially
loved Father Ambrose St. John, whose name
he accentuates on the last page of the "Apologia."
Father St. John, who was of the Gordon family, died in
1875, and Newman suffered what he held to be his
saddest bereavement. Ambrose St. John had been
with him at Littlemore. Writing to Mr. Dering of
the death of Father Ambrose St. John, he said: "I never
had so great a loss. He had been my life under God for
twenty-two years." The dread of dying alone and the
deep affection for friends&mdash;an affection that reaches
the throne of God by prayer&mdash;tinge the whole structure
of "The Dream." They are part of Newman himself.</p>

<p>Cardinal Newman died at Edgbaston Oratory, August
11, 1890; he was buried, at his own request, in the grave
with Father Ambrose St. John. "'The Dream of Gerontius'
was composed in great grief after the death of a
dear friend."</p>

<p>A careful study of "The Dream of Gerontius" will
show how musical it is, and how delicately the music of
the verse changes with the themes. The form of poetry,
as we know, approaches music. If a poem is not musical
in expression, its metres fail of producing the effect
they are intended to produce. So musical is "The
Dream of Gerontius" and so capable of being treated
by the musicians, that various composers suggested
the making of an oratorio of it. Dr. Elgar has done
it. "An Ursuline," in <cite>The Catholic World</cite>, for June,
1903, says: "Dr. Elgar, when a child, sat Sunday after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Sunday in the organ-loft of St. George's Roman Catholic
Church, Worcester, England, where his father had been
organist for the long period of thirty-seven years. Subtly
the spirit of the grand old church music was instilled
into the boy." Of "The Dream" Dr. Elgar said:
"The poem has been soaking in my mind for at least
eight years. All that time I had been gradually assimilating
the thoughts of the author into my musical
promptings." In 1889 a copy of the poem, with the
markings made by General Gordon, was presented to
Dr. Elgar as a wedding gift. The markings of the
heroic and devout Gordon especially interested him.
The reading of this little book helped to make Dr.
Elgar's fame, which is based solely on his masterpiece,
the oratorio performed in London on June 6, 1903,
in Westminster Cathedral. Richard Strauss is looked
on by musicians as the master of what is called
"tone-color"&mdash;a perfect harmony between the tone of the
instrument and the music arranged for it. But the
German and English critics declare that in "The Dream
of Gerontius" Dr. Elgar has surpassed Richard Strauss.
"The Demons' Chorus," says The <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>,
"may be regarded as one of the last words of musical
audacity." For the study of the music we suggest
Dr. Jaeger's Analysis, printed by Novello in London
and New York. Mr. Theodore Thomas, speaking of
Dr. Elgar's "Dream of Gerontius," said that it is the
most important oratorio of recent times, not excepting
Brahms' Requiem. "'Gerontius,'" he added, "is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
lofty work, and, from a technical point of view, more
masterly than Brahms ever dreamed of. It is by far
the most important and satisfying modern work
written for voices and orchestra."</p>

<p>It is understood that Cardinal Newman himself suggested
that his poem should be set to music. The
delicacy of his ear as to sounds is shown by the changes
of the verse-music,&mdash;which is made up of accent, pause,
and rhythm,&mdash;to fit the varying feeling of the work.
If the student will scan the lines and reduce them to
musical expression,&mdash;leaving out, of course, the quality
of pitch, he can easily corroborate this.<a name="Anchor-B" id="Anchor-B"></a><a href="#Footnote-B" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10.">[B]</a>
</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img-019a.jpg" width="400" height="88" alt="Jesu, Maria, I am near to death, And Thou art calling me." />
</div>

<p>This is in two-beat rhythm:<a name="Anchor-C" id="Anchor-C"></a><a href="#Footnote-C" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10.">[C]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img-019b.jpg" width="400" height="92" alt="" />

</div>

<p>The first syllable of "Jesu" is the anacrusis; the
measure of the metre begins with the first accent.
Whether this system of verse-notation or that of the
usual scansion be followed, the meaning of the changing
forms will be made plain. The system of verse-notation
will be found more satisfactory in the metrical
study of the poem. The second form of primary
rhythm&mdash;that based on three beats in the measure&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>is
effectively used. We find it in the Song of the
Demons:</p>

<h2 class="break-avoid"><a name="JOHN_HENRY_NEWMAN" id="JOHN_HENRY_NEWMAN">JOHN HENRY NEWMAN</a></h2>


<p>Born in the city of London, February 21, 1801, son
of Mr. John Newman (of the banking firm of Ramsbottom,
Newman &amp; Co.) and of Jemima Fourdrinier,
his wife.</p>

<p>Went at an early age to Dr. Nicholas's school at Ealing,
to the head of which he rapidly rose. Thence
to Trinity College, Oxford, graduating in 1820.</p>

<p>In 1823 was elected to a Fellowship at Oriel.</p>

<p>In 1824 took Anglican orders and became curate
of St. Clements, Oxford.</p>

<p>In 1828 was appointed vicar of St. Mary the Virgin,
Oxford, with the outlying chaplaincy of Littlemore.</p>

<p>In 1832 finished <cite>History of the Arians</cite> and went
abroad. Made acquaintance with Dr. Wiseman in
Rome; seized with fever in Sicily, but said, "I shall
not die&mdash;I have a work to do in England"; returning
homewards in an orange-boat bound for Marseilles,
and within sight of Garibaldi's home at Caprera, wrote
"Lead, Kindly Light."</p>

<p>On July 13, 1833, the Sunday after his return home,
the Oxford movement was begun by Keble's sermon
on National Apostasy. The issue of <cite>Tracts for the
Times</cite> immediately followed; and in 1843 Mr. New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>man
published a volume of <cite>Parochial Sermons</cite>, to be
followed by <cite>University Sermons</cite> and <cite>Sermons on Holy
Days</cite>.</p>

<p>In 1841 the Vice-Chancellor and heads of houses at
Oxford censured Mr. Newman's Tract XC.</p>

<p>In 1843 he resigned St. Mary's.</p>

<p>On October 9, 1845, was received into the Catholic
Church at Littlemore by Father Dominic.</p>

<p>On November 1, 1845, was confirmed at Oscott by
Cardinal Wiseman.</p>

<p>On October 28, 1846, arrived in Rome, and, after a
short period of study, was ordained priest.</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve, 1847, he returned to England
from Rome, to found the community of St. Philip
de Neri.</p>

<p>In January, 1849, part of the Oratorian Community
settled in Birmingham.</p>

<p>In 1849 took up temporary residence at Bilston, to
nurse the poor during a visitation of cholera.</p>

<p>In April, 1849, founded the London Oratory, with
Father Faber as rector.</p>

<p>On June 21, 1852, the case of Achilli against Dr.
Newman came on for trial before Lord Campbell, and,
after several days' duration, resulted in a verdict of
"guilty," Dr. Newman being unjustly sentenced to a
fine and mulcted in enormous costs. The Rev. John
Joseph Gordon, to whom "The Dream of Gerontius"
is dedicated, was of great assistance to Newman at
this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1854 went to Dublin as rector of the newly founded
Irish Catholic University, but resigned that post in
1858, and subsequently established a boys' school at
Birmingham.</p>

<p>In 1864 Charles Kingsley made charges of untruthfulness
against the Catholic clergy, which led to the
writing of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Apologia Pro Vita Sua</i>.</p>

<p>In December, 1877, was elected an Honorary Fellow
of Trinity College, Oxford.</p>

<p>In 1865 he printed "The Dream of Gerontius."</p>

<p>In 1879 created Cardinal Deacon of the Holy Roman
Church by Leo XIII.</p>

<p>On Monday, August 11, 1890, died at the Oratory,
Edgbaston, Birmingham, England.</p>

As suggested in the Introduction, the musical character of
the verse of "The Dream of Gerontius" is brought out more
and more by careful study of the changes of the meaning of
the poem and their expression. "The Dream" is a series of
lyrics,&mdash;each lyric voicing its own feeling and sensitively tuned
to that feeling. According to the scansion most in use in English,
the first supplicating lyric may be classed as in pentameter
iambic. Gerontius is yet in the body, and the rime, used
solemnly, marks a difference&mdash;which has a delicate symbolism&mdash;between
his utterances in the body and his utterances when
his soul has left the body. What we call blank verse is used
by the Spirit&mdash;rime disappears, but the rhythm remains the
same. Using verse-notation, we find five accented notes
in each line, if we consider the lines at all. There are two
quarter-notes in each bar, which may be written as</p>
 <div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p><a name="Footnote-12" id="Footnote-12"></a><span class="label">[<a title="Return to text." href="#Anchor-12">12</a>]</span>
(p. 25.) Gerontius dreams that he is dying. He has not
strength to pray. He hears the persons near his bed praying for
him, in the language prescribed by the Church, "The Litany for
the Dying." The three opening invocations are in Greek, "Kyrie
Eleison" ("Lord, have mercy"), "Christe Eleison" ("Christ,
have mercy"), "Kyrie Eleison" ("Lord, have mercy"). The next
invocation in the Litany is "Sancta Maria, Ora pro eo," which
Cardinal Newman translates into English. With the exception
of the first three and the last two invocations, the Litany is in
Latin. The Litany is too long for the purpose of the poem,
and the author has translated into English some of the invocations
that would naturally strike the "fainting soul." "Be
merciful" ("Propitius esto"), the assistants continue, still using
parts of the Litany as versified by Cardinal Newman.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote-13" id="Footnote-13"></a><span class="label">[<a title="Return to text." href="#Anchor-13">13</a>]</span>
"<i>Kyrie Eleïson</i>," etc. The poet has retained the sound-form
used in the Prayer-books, and he shows his musical taste by
not changing it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote-14" id="Footnote-14"></a><span class="label">[<a title="Return to text." href="#Anchor-14">14</a>]</span>
"<i>Rouse thee</i>," etc. Gerontius concentrates all his vitality.
The effect is of nervous energy. The time is quickened and
alternately slowed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote-15" id="Footnote-15"></a><span class="label">[<a title="Return to text." href="#Anchor-15">15</a>]</span>
"<i>Be merciful</i>," etc. The Assistants begin with the solemn
chant of the Church, and change to the supplication of anxious
human hearts:</p>

"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sanctus fortis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sanctus Deus</i>," etc. This is the ecstasy of
faith, hope, and love. It is three Acts in one, rapidly and
forcibly expressed. The energy and strength of self-forgetfulness
fail when he, still in the body, sighs:
</p>
<p class="blockquot">"I can no more; for now it comes again,"&mdash;</p>

(p. 35.) "Another marvel." According to the teaching of
the Catholic Church, each soul is given at its birth in charge of a
Guardian Angel. It is this angel that sings, "My work is done."
"Alleluia" is from two Hebrew words united by a hyphen. It
means "Praise the Lord." St. John in the Apocalypse says
that he heard the angels singing it in heaven. It occurs in
the last five Psalms and in Tobias.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
